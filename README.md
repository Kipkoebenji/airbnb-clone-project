🧠 Why Identifying Design Properties from a Mockup Matters
Identifying design properties such as colors and typography from a mockup is crucial because:

🎯 Consistency: It ensures the user interface remains visually consistent across all pages and components.

🛠️ Efficient Development: Developers can reference exact values instead of guessing, reducing back-and-forth with designers.

🧩 Reusable Components: Standardized design tokens (like color and font) make it easier to build and scale UI components.

🧠 Better UX: A well-defined visual system improves readability, usability, and overall user trust in the platform.

📱 Responsive Design: Understanding font sizes and spacing from the mockup helps in creating interfaces that adapt well across devices.
